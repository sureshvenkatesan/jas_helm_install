# Oracle Instant Client Setup with Custom artifactory-pro image

Please review [Java 11 Licensing: What Youâ€™re Really Asking](https://jfrog.com/blog/java-11-licensing-what-youre-really-asking/).

Oracle Instant Client is a mandatory requirement because the JFrog metadata service does not use the JDBC driver since its a Go application and not Java. Therefore, to support the connection between Artifactory and database, you would need to install the thin client (type 4) and the OCI (type 2).

The Oracle Instant Client Type2 driver ([instantclient-basic-linux.x64-21.11.0.0.0dbru.zip](https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/2111000/instantclient-basic-linux.x64-21.11.0.0.0dbru.zip)) and later versions is licensed under the 
GPL, and JFrog is  not permitted to distribute it (with the exception of the PostgreSQL driver). 

Therefore JFrog cannot build a custom Artifactory Docker image that includes this driver .

Please use the right Oracle Instant Client Type2 driver from
[Oracle Instant Client Downloads for Linux x86-64 (64-bit)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html)
which  contains both the  thin client (type 4) jdbc driver and the OCI (type 2) client that is 
compatible with the JRE version mentioned in 
[Java Requirements for JFrog Products](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/java-requirements-for-jfrog-products)
as recommended by Oracle in [Oracle Database JDBC driver and Companion Jars Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html).

As per Artifactory [Embedded OpenJDK Version](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-release-information/embedded-openjdk-version)
JFrog artifactory versions between 7.46.3 and 7.98.14 ship with openjdk version 17.

From JFrog artifactory version 7.104.5 it ships with  openjdk version 21 (openjdk version "21.0.5" 2024-10-15 LTS).

As per [Oracle Database JDBC driver and Companion Jars Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html)
the **ojdbc17.jar** is certified with bith JDK 17 and 21.

As per [ARTIFACTORY: How to configure Artifactory with an external database when using Artifactory Helm Installation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/artifactory-how-to-configure-artifactory-with-an-external-database-when-using-artifactory-helm-installation) 
 -> [Oracle for Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/oracle-for-artifactory) 
 -> [Configure Artifactory to use Oracle](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/configure-artifactory-to-use-oracle) ,
you could use Oracle Instant Client Type2 driver ([instantclient-basic-linux.x64-23.7.0.25.01.zip](https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/2370000/instantclient-basic-linux.x64-23.7.0.25.01.zip))
which also has thin client (type 4) jdbc driver i.e **ojdbc17.jar**.


### Proposed Solution

We suggest that you create a custom  `releases-docker.jfrog.io/jfrog/artifactory-pro image`  that includes the Oracle 
Instant Client `instantclient-basic-linux.x64-23.7.0.25.01.zip`. 

## Steps to Implement the Solution

### 1. Build a Custom `releases-docker.jfrog.io/jfrog/artifactory-pro` image`


#### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM releases-docker.jfrog.io/jfrog/artifactory-pro:7.84.14
USER root
RUN mkdir -p /opt/oracle/
COPY instantclient-basic-linux.x64-23.7.0.25.01.zip /opt/oracle/
RUN mkdir -p /opt/oracle/instantclient && cd /opt/oracle/instantclient && \
    unzip -j ../instantclient-basic-linux.x64-23.7.0.25.01.zip && \
    cp /opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/artifactory/libaio/* ./ && \
    chown -R artifactory:artifactory /opt/oracle/instantclient
USER artifactory
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/oracle/instantclient"
```
**Note:** used "/opt/oracle/instantclient" instead of "/opt/oracle/instantclient_23_7" in case you want to upgrade 
the driver in future

### 2. Steps to Build the Docker Image

1. **Create a directory** and place both the `instantclient-basic-linux.x64-23.7.0.25.01.zip` file and the `Dockerfile` inside it.

2. **Build the Docker image**:

```bash
docker build -t sv-artifactory-pro:v7.84.14 .
```

3. **Tag the Docker image** for your container registry:

```bash
docker tag sv-artifactory-pro:v7.84.14 psazuse.jfrog.io/<your-repo>/sv-artifactory-pro:v7.84.14
```

4. **Push the Docker image** to your container registry:

```bash
docker push psazuse.jfrog.io/<your-repo>/sv-artifactory-pro:v7.84.14
```

Replace `your-repo` with the appropriate repository you're using.

### 3. Use the Custom Image 

Once the image is built and pushed to the container registry, you will modify the `values-artifactory.yaml` to use this custom Docker image 

#### Modify `values-artifactory.yaml`

1. Use the custom image  as below:
```artifactory:
  name: artifactory
  image:
    registry: psazuse.jfrog.io
    repository: sv-test-docker/sv-artifactory-pro
    tag: v7.84.14
  preStartCommand: "mkdir -p /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/bootstrap/artifactory/tomcat/lib/; cp /opt/oracle/instantclient/ojdbc17.jar /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/bootstrap/artifactory/tomcat/lib/"
  extraEnvironmentVariables:
    - name: LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      value: /opt/oracle/instantclient:/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/bootstrap/artifactory/tomcat/lib
```
See  in [artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml](artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml)

**Note:** The `preStartCommand` and `extraEnvironmentVariables` are required.

Also if you are pulling the `artifactory-pro` image from a  docker registry for example `psazuse.jfrog.io` that is different from the 
`global.imageRegistry` then set that value to an empty string as shown  in [../install_artifactory_from_artifactory_chart/values/values-main.yaml#L23](../install_artifactory_from_artifactory_chart/values/values-main.yaml#L23) and [artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml#L94-L97](artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml#L94-L97) which actually uses Oracle database for persistence.

Note: In my test lab in GCP since I used postgres database for artifactory persistence I tested the oracle driver mounting  using [../install_artifactory_from_artifactory_chart/values/values-artifactory-gcp-gstorage-postgres-w-oci-type2driver-in-rt
-image.yaml#L88-L90](../install_artifactory_from_artifactory_chart/values/values-artifactory-gcp-gstorage-postgres-w-oci-type2driver-in-rt-image.yaml#L88-L90)



### 4. Deploy or Upgrade the Helm Chart
**Note:** the steps to set the environmental variables is in the main [readme.md](readme.md)

After modifying the [artifactory/values-artifactory.yaml](artifactory/values-artifactory.yaml) to [artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml](artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml) , you can deploy or upgrade your Helm chart with the following command:

a) First do a Dry run:
```
helm upgrade --install $MY_HELM_RELEASE \
-f ../artifactory/values-main.yaml \
-f ../artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml \
-f ../artifactory/artifactory-large.yaml \
-f ../artifactory/artifactory-large-extra-config.yaml \
--namespace $MY_NAMESPACE \
--set global.versions.artifactory="${RT_VERSION}" \
--dry-run \
./artifactory-107.84.14.tgz
```
b). Next run without the --dry-run
```
helm upgrade --install $MY_HELM_RELEASE \
-f ../artifactory/values-main.yaml \
-f ../artifactory/values-artifactory_w_oci_type2_in_artifactory-pro_image.yml \
-f ../artifactory/artifactory-large.yaml \
-f ../artifactory/artifactory-large-extra-config.yaml \
--namespace $MY_NAMESPACE \
--set global.versions.artifactory="${RT_VERSION}" \
./artifactory-107.84.14.tgz
```

### Conclusion

This approach allows us to include the Oracle Instant Client in  a customized `releases-docker.jfrog.io/jfrog/artifactory-pro:7.84.14` image without needed the customInitContainers.
